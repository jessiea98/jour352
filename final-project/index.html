  <h1> Unemployment in the United States Over Time </h1>

  <p>
    Unemployment and the unemployment rate have undergone several distinct trends in the United States over the course of time, and there are visible trends in local areas such as Prince Georges county and other counties in Maryland too. To discuss these trends and changes it's important to know exactly what unemployment is and the difference between unemployment and the unemployment rate. Oxford dictionary defines unemployment as “the state of being unemployed.” This definition is relatively broad and does not give a complete picture of the inputs of the unemployment rate. The actual unemployment rate is defined by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development as the people who are above 15 that are not being paid in employment or self-employment but are currently available to work for the reference period.

    According to thebalance.com, unemployment is actually measured by the unemployment rate as the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the entire labor force. There are a lot of external factors that affect the unemployment rate, such as recessions, government policies, new technologies and inventions, globalization and international trade, and market regulations. There are also several different types of unemployment. Some of the forms of unemployment include structural unemployment, frictional unemployment, cyclical unemployment, involuntary unemployment, and classical unemployment.

  <p>
    Structural unemployment is caused by a mismatch in skills that workers can offer versus skills that employers need. Frictional unemployment is usually unemployment when a worker is in between when a worker ends their previous job and when they start their new job. Cyclical unemployment occurs when the demand for jobs does not meet the supply of workers to do these jobs. Involuntary unemployment occurs when a worker is willing to work for a certain wage, but the supply of similar workers is too high and there are not employers that are willing to hire them. Classical unemployment is when wages are high enough in a particular job that the supply of workers exceeds the demand for workers.

    As far as trends in unemployment in the United States in general, one of the earlier large scale changes came as a result of the Great Depression. According to ushistory.org, in the 1920’s, the United States boasted the strongest economy in the world. Then in 1929, the stock market crashed and set off a chain of events that would lead to one of the largest economic crises in United States history. Due to this, the unemployment rate in the U.S. was at 24.9%. The unemployment rate remained above 14% from 1931 to 1940. After that, the unemployment rate remained in the single digits until it increased to 10.1% in September of 1982. During the relatively recent Great Recession, the unemployment rate increased to 10.1% in October 2009. Recently, in the midst of the global Covid-19 pandemic, unemployment has unsurprisingly risen. While the statistics are not completely up to date, unemployment claims have risen from about 10,000 in March to over 6 million in April.

    More specifically and locally, the unemployment in most parts of Maryland has remained relatively steady. According to the Department of Labor, the county with the highest unemployment rate in the last two years has been Worcester county, which reached a 10.9% in January 2020.
  Unemployment has been relatively low in counties such as Howard and Montgomery county, where the unemployment rate has never risen above 3% in the last two years.

    In the counties surrounding us such as Prince George’s county and Anne Arundel county, unemployment has also been relatively low. In Prince George’s county, unemployment has been around 3.5% over the last two years, and has never risen above 4% in the last two years. In Anne Arundel county, unemployment has been low and has floated around the 2.5%-2.7% range and only reached 3.0% in January 2020. According to NBCnews.com, there have been 347,367 total unemployment claims since March 14, 2020. That is 10.6% of the state labor force. In March 2020, Maryland’s total jobs decreased by 20,900 and the unemployment rate remained at 3.3%,  according to the U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics. There were 36,471 initial claims filed during the week ending April 25. There were 48,495 claims filed the previous week.
